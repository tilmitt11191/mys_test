Abstract-Twitch 
is a streaming platform that lets users 
broadcast their screen whilst playing games. People can share 
their game experience and interact with others in real time. 
Twitch has now become the fourth largest source of peak Internet 
traffic in the US. This paper explores the unique nature of this 
platform over a 11 month dataset. We find that Twitch is very 
different to existing video platforms, with 
a small number of 
games consistently 
achieving phenomenal dominance. We find a 
complex game ecosystem combining consistently 
popular games 
over years, newly released games enjoying bursts of popularity, 
and even old games appearing 
on the platform. Despite a strong 
skew of views across channels, the top ranked channels, although 
taking a significant share of the viewers, exhibit unexpectedly 
high churn. The reason behind this churn 
lies within another 
unique feature of this ecosystem, 
namely tournaments, 
live events 
that last for a 
limited amount of time but are capable 
of attracting 
a huge share of views when they take place, as well as 
dominate 
the views of the related games. Overall, our work reveals a 
complex and rich ecosystem, very different from existing user 
generated content platforms.

in terms of how viewers are spread

by analyzing 
live viewing figures collected 
over an 11 month period.

provide insight 
into the 
growing scale of Twitch (§ II). We

through 
the platform

Twitch closer to a live sports

games. 

A. Which games are played? 

TABLE I: Top 10 games in Twitch. 

B. Game features 

A basic and fundamental 
question 
to understand 
Twitch 
is what games are actually 
broadcast? 
To explore this, we 
use the 'game' field returned 
from the Twitch API. We 
observe a total number of 127,497 different 
name strings. 
The previous 
section 
has highlighted 
that a few prominent

techniques 
(such as Levenshtein

because 
of the predominance 
of game sequels 
that would be wrongly 
resolved. 
We next inspect 
the respective 
viewing and broadcast 
figures 
attained 
by these 21k games. We therefore 
begin by inspecting 
which games are most frequently 
broadcast 
and viewed in 
Twitch. 
Much like music artists 
vie for airtime 
on radio, game 
developers 
may wish to see their games effectively 
promoted 
on Twitch. We observed 
41 games that were streamed 
in 
Twitch prior to their release date (often through official 
channels 
from the developers). 
This suggests 
that developers 
are using Twitch to gather feedback 
and generate 
interest 
on 
upcoming games. 
Table I presents 
the top 10 (0.04%) games found in Twitch. 
It can be seen that there is a strongly 
uneven distribution 
of viewers and broadcasters 
across these games. The top 
10% of games collect 
95% of all viewers (far higher than

to the broadcasting

the HE3 press conferences" 
(the main video games festival) 
on June 9th 2014, which shifted 
viewers away from the 
usual content genres enjoyed by users. It can also be seen 
that notable shifts occur with views transferring 
between 
these popular genres; for example, 
role playing games lost 
a significant 
share of their viewing figures to other genres 
in mid-April 
(this was caused by the fading popularity 
of a 
viral phenomenon, 
Twitch Plays Pokemon [11]). This is just 
one example of the complex interactions 
between simultaneous 
events occurring 
in Twitch.

are grouped per game: Counter Strike:

Pokemon, Starcraft

We also inspect 
the relationship 
between events and games 
(see color code in Figure 3). Tournaments 
playing 
League of 
Legends (LoL) achieve the highest 
and most frequent peaks. 
Numerous events playing

games and channels. 
To answer this, Figure 6 shows how many 
games have been played by each channel over its lifespan.

can be observed,

can be seen that broadcasters 
with high viewing figures tend 
to play many games. For channels 
that garner between 100 
and 10k viewers, 
only 30.4% play a single game. Moreover, 
roughly half of the popular subscription

tend to play fewer games. This indicates 
that 
there is no direct relationship 
between gaining 
viewers 
and the 
number of games played. 
Instead,

Exploiting 
the knowledge 
introduced 
by these games is a ripe area of further 
exploration. 
For 
instance, 
use of game information 
for things like recommender 
engines would be highly beneficial. 
Similarly, 
the observation 
that many users watch the same games (potentially 
played 
by different 
streamers) 
may indicate 
that such recommender 
engines could easily guide users to nearby (low-cost) 
stream­
ers, rather than distant 
(high-cost) 
streamers 
playing 
the same 
game [14]. A key finding of our work is the preference 
users 
have for particular 
users, which suggests 
that this would have 
to be done with caution: 
players 
are certainly 
not all equal. 
Unlike many other streaming

in-mind. 
We already 
see this with many 
prominent 
games having in-built 
support for Twitch. Finally, 
the growing popularity 
of Twitch should be treated 
as a wake­
up call for TV broadcast outlets. Broadcast 
is an extremely 
efficient medium for popular content 
and, as such, we argue 
it is only a matter of time before gameplay content 
becomes 
commonplace 
on TV broadcast, 
much like other sports.

Video gaming has a history 
spanning 
decades. 
Recently, 
researchers 
have turned their attentions 
to online gaming, look­
ing at its evolution 
[10]. Furthermore, 
online social gaming has 
recently 
emerged as a hot topic, as it integrates 
the fields of 
gaming with that of social networking 
[9], [6], [13]. This work 
is very different 
to our own, though, 
as we focus on the nature 
of streaming games, rather than playing 
them. 
It could be argued that Twitch is more closely 
related 
to 
general 
video streaming 
platforms, 
particularly 
user generated 
content (UGC) repositories. 
Many studies 
have been devoted 
to other UGC platforms 
[5], [7], [19]. Our work is orthogonal 
to these, as we show the live broadcasting 
nature of Twitch 
makes it fundamentally 
different 
to these platforms. 
A small set of researchers 
have started 
look into Twitch 
from different 
perspectives. 
Most notably, 
[12] explored 
the 
early stages of Twitch (in 2012), finding channel viewing 
figures were highly predictable 
by looking at its early viewing 
figures. 
We have explored 
the actual content 
(i.e., games and 
tournaments) 
being broadcast 
by channels. 
This has allowed us 
to shed light on the underlying 
driving 
factors 
of popularity 
on 
Twitch. 
Other researchers 
have recently 
explored 
the delivery 
infrastructure 
of Twitch; for instance, 
measuring 
the traffic 
generated 
by certain 
channels 
[8], [17], [18], mapping the 
video delivery 
infrastructure 
[21] and building 
models of user 
chat interactions 
[15]. 

VIII. CONCLUSION 

In this paper we have explored 
the most popular 
game 
streaming 
platform 
in the world, Twitch. 
We have uncovered 
in 
the paper that the popularity 
of game streams 
possesses 
unique 
characteristics 
distinct 
from traditional 
channels, 
broadcasters
